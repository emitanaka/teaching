# Geographic coordinate reference systems

* **Geographic CRSs** identify a location on the Earth's surface by *longitude* and *latitude*.
* **Longitude** is the East-West direction in angular distance from the Prime Meridian plane.
* **Latitude** is the angular distance North or South of the equatorial plane.
