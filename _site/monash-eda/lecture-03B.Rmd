* We can fit linear models in R with the `lm` function:
```r
lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
```
is the same as
```r
lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
```

* The above model is mathematically written as 
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + e_i$$
where <ul>
<li>\\(y_i\\) and \\(x_i\\) are the  stopping distance (in ft) and speed (in mph), respectively, of the \\(i\\)-th car;</li> <li>\\(\beta_0\\) and \\(\beta_1\\) are intercept and slope, respectively; and</li>

# .circle.bg-black.white[2] Model formulation .f4[Part 2/2]

* Notice that we did _**no formal statistical inference**_ as we initially try to formulate the model.
--


* The goal of the main analysis is to characterise the price of a diamond by its carat. This may involve:
   * formal inference for model selection;
   * justification of the selected "final" model; and
   * fitting the final model.
--


* There may be in fact many, many models considered but discarded at the IDA stage. 
--


* These discarded models are hardly ever reported. Consequently, majority of reported statistics give a distorted view and it's important to remind yourself what might _**not**_ be reported.

# .orange[Case study] .circle.bg-orange.white[4]  Wheat yield in South Australia .f4[Part 1/9]

A wheat breeding trial to test 107 varieties (also called genotype) is conducted in a field experiment laid out in a rectangular array with 22 rows and 15 columns.

# .orange[Case study] .circle.bg-orange.white[4]  Wheat yield in South Australia .f4[Part 2/9]

**Experimental Design**

* The experiment employs what is referred to as a **randomised complete block design** (RCBD) .f4[(technically it is _near_-complete and not exactly RCBD due to check varieties have double the replicates of test varieties)].
--

* RCBD means that 
    * the there are equal number of replicates for each treatment (here it is `gen`); 
    * each treatment appears exactly once in each block; 
    * the blocks are of the same size; and
    * each treatment are randomised within block.
--


* In agricultural field experiments, blocks are formed spatially by grouping plots within contiguous areas (called `rep` here). 
* The boundaries of blocks may be chosen arbitrary.

**Analysis**

* In the main analysis, people would commonly analyse this using what is called **two-way ANOVA** model (with no interaction effect).
* The two-way ANOVA model has the form
<center>
<code>yield = mean + block + treatment + error</code>
</center>
* So for this data,
```{r, echo = TRUE}
fit <- lm(yield ~ 1 + rep + gen, 
          data = gilmour.serpentine)
```

* It's well known in agricultural field trials that spatial variations are introduced in traits; this could be because of the fertility trend, management practices or other reasons.
* In the IDA stage, you investigate to identify these spatial variations - you cannot just simply fit a two-way ANOVA model!
